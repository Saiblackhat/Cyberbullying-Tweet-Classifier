# Cyberbullying-Tweet-Classifier
The Cyber Bullying Tweet Classifier project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify tweets as either cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying. The project's primary objective is to create a system that can automatically detect and flag cyberbullying tweets, helping to create a safer online environment.
